# 📖 Overview

The **Smart Attendance System** is a modern web-based attendance management platform that uses **Artificial Intelligence** and **Face Recognition** to automate the attendance process.

The system captures live images from the camera, detects and recognizes registered students, verifies schedules, and automatically marks attendance in the database. It eliminates manual attendance, reduces proxy attendance, and provides teachers with an efficient and user-friendly attendance management solution.

---

## 👨‍🎓 Step 2: Register Students

- As Admin Navigate to **Student Management**.
- Add student details.
- Capture or upload student face images.
- The system generates and stores face embeddings for future recognition.

---

## 👨‍🏫 Step 3: Manage Teachers & Subjects

-As Admin add teacher information.
- Create subjects.
- Assign teachers to subjects.

---

## 📅 Step 4: Create Schedule

- Open the **Schedule Module**.

---

## 🤖 Step 6: Face Recognition

The AI service:

- Detects faces using OpenCV.
- Extracts facial embeddings using DeepFace.
- Matches faces using GhostFaceNet .
- Identifies registered students.

---

## ✅ Step 7: Attendance Marking

If the student is:

- Registered
- Recognized
- Scheduled for that class

The attendance is automatically recorded in MongoDB.

---
